Discrete Optimization Leader Board (Archive)
======

This code was used for building the leader board in the first three sessions of [Discrete Optimization]("https://www.coursera.org/learn/optimization/") on Coursera.  Changes to how programming assignments are handled on the second generation Coursera platform have thus far prevented the generation of a leader board in subsequent sessions.  For now, this code is in an archival state.
